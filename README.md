# Oauth2 with Spring Security 5.2.x 

There are sample resource-server and resource-client spring-boot applications which demonstrate how a service to service secure communication can occur. Got most of the reference information from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Migration-Guide. This example was tested against UAA as described in https://www.baeldung.com/cloud-foundry-uaa
